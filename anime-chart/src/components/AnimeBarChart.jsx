      'Many anime are adapted from manga, which are Japanese comic books or graphic novels. "Manga" can appear in several formats: traditional print manga sold in books and magazines; digital manga designed for online reading; 4-koma manga, which are short, four-panel comic strips often used for humor; and web manga, which are self-published or officially serialized comics released on the internet. Manga is one of the most common sources for anime stories, ranging across genres from action and fantasy to romance and slice of life.',

    description:
      '"Original" anime are not based on any pre-existing material like books, manga, or games. Instead, they are created entirely for television or film by anime studios and writers. Since there is no source material, original anime can be highly unpredictable in terms of story and character development. They offer fresh narratives that are crafted directly for the anime format, sometimes leading to more creative storytelling but also carrying a risk of inconsistent pacing or endings.',

      'Novels are longer prose works, often aimed at a general or adult audience. Most common novels are Light novels, which are shorter, more accessible books often targeted at young adults, typically featuring anime-style illustrations and fast-paced storytelling. Many popular anime start from light novels that already have a strong fan following.',

      "Some anime are adapted from video games or card games. These might expand on a game's storyline, deepen character backgrounds, or reimagine the gameplay as a full narrative. Popular examples include role-playing games (RPGs), fighting games, or collectible card games that already have built-in worlds and lore. Game-based anime sometimes aim to promote the original game while offering standalone entertainment. Games also include visual novels, where players read a story and make choices that affect the outcome.",

  Music: {

    description:
      "Some anime are created as visual accompaniments to a song or musical track, often in the form of anime music videos (AMVs) or short projects. These are usually tied to a specific musical work rather than a full narrative. They might feature original songs by music artists, Vocaloid productions, or concept projects where the animation and music are closely integrated. Instead of adapting a long story, these anime focus on creating a visual experience that complements the music.",
